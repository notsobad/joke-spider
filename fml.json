{"cont": "Today, my wife allowed my mother-in-law to move in with us.

I have to live with this psychotic wench until someone is desperate enough to employ her. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I was messing around in computer class, when somebody called my name from the hall. Trying to be smooth, I tried rolling my chair backwards out into the hall. The wheels wasted no time jamming and sending me crashing face-first into the floor in front of everyone. FML"}

FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I found out that a family member found a publisher for his book; his badly written, terribly sourced, historically inaccurate book that insults and misrepresents most world cultures and religions.

{"cont": "Today, I woke up soaked in water. It seems at some point in the middle of the night, I woke up thirsty and opened the water bottle I keep on my nightstand. I managed to drink a little, but it seems I didn't  manage to put the cap back on before losing consciousness again. FML"}

Now I'm bleeding out my period on top of the lingering wounds down there. It hurts even to pee, let alone menstruate. FML"}
{"cont": "Today,  my license to carry a gun expired because my manager forgot to renew it. As I'm an armored car guard, this is a problem.

{"cont": "Today, I had to tell all the trick-or-treaters that I'd run out of candy. I'd actually bought about $50 worth of candy, but managed to eat all of it by myself, sitting alone in my apartment, exactly like last year. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, I'm very ill. My throat and glands are so swollen that whenever I fall asleep, I relax too much and cut off my own air.

{"cont": "Today, I was the 19th wheel at a party. Yes, I counted. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, my husband's car was stolen from our driveway while he was out jogging. We'd recently had a huge fight, and he accused me of having done this to get revenge. I was at work all day, but it seems this doesn't make any difference to his dumb, paranoid ass. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, while standing in line at the supermarket, I reached past my wife to get a pack of gum.

We've been together two years. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I saw a group of attractive guys at the mall. One of them looked exactly like a friend, so I decided to take a picture. Trying to be discreet, I put my phone up to my ear as if I was making a phone call, and pressed the capture button. The flash went off. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, my doctor told me that the reason I'm losing my eyesight is because I'm straining my eyes, and that the best thing for me to do is to limit my time in front of computers. I spent years in college to get my current job which involves sitting in front of computers. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, while in the grocery store my boyfriend said very loudly \"Don't make me hit you in public again!\" He says things like this every time we are in the grocery store line.

{"cont": "Today, I was in a rush and had to get changed in a train restroom. While changing, I leaned against the button that opened the door.

{"cont": "Today, my boss made me run yet another stupid errand. When I delivered the paperwork to his office, I saw an email printout on his desk. Apparently, he has a plan in the works to get me FRIED next month. I'm not sure whether to give him a letter of resignation or a bottle of barbecue sauce. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, I was at my boyfriend's apartment, when I came across a lacy black thong in the laundry. When confronted, he swore it was his. I don't know what's worse, the possibility that another woman left it there, or the idea that my boyfriend owns and wears women's lingerie. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, I was trying to take the cap off a can of spray cooking oil. It was really stuck so I pulled extra hard. It flew off and I punched myself in the head.

{"cont": "Today, I went to throw out the garbage outside. I noticed at the bottom of my can was a lot of rice. I was angry at my brother for making a mess. As I went to clean it up, the rice moved. It wasn't rice, it was maggots.  FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I went on a date with a great vegan guy in my class. We went to a vegi-restaurant, I dutifully ate all the meatless dishes, but he seemed pissed about something, and other diners kept giving me angry looks. After we left, I realised I'd worn my leather jacket to the date. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I found out a guy I had a thing with a while back thinks I am obsessed with him. This is because when he said that we should be friends, I stupidly thought he was being sincere and bothered to call him all of three times in the last five months. Clearly a sign of obsession. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, while waiting to do a presentation in class I felt someone flick my back, but when I turned around no one was there. It wasn't until I got up in front of the whole class that I felt my bra slowly sliding down my body. Turns out that the \"flick\" I felt was actually my bra clasp busting open. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I found out why my boyfriend of over a year is so obsessed with cleaning his entire place before I come over. He's been hiding the ex girlfriend that never moved out. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I heard a rumor about myself going around my high school that I am pregnant, I've dropped out of school, and that my belly is showing.  I'm not actually pregnant. I've been severely depressed, so I've missed a few days of school and I've been eating too much apparently. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, my mom drove my family to the desert for a themed family photo. We had to wear big frumpy old western-looking clothes in 115 degree weather.

{"cont": "Today, my girlfriend broke up with me because I brought to her attention a rather large zit on the corner of her mouth. She called me an insensitive prick. I only pointed it out because I didn't want other people to see it and make fun of her. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, I was doing takeout orders at the restaurant I work at. I spent a long while putting together this guy's $135.00 order. When he finally got there to pick it up, I told him to fill out the credit card slip. I looked at it after he left. He gave me a 40 cent tip. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I had my final economics exam, and needed to ace it, or else I would fail the entire module.

Unfortunately, my teacher didn't believe that it was possible, and accused me of cheating. Now I may be thrown out of college. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I spilled a glass of iced tea all over my desk. It trickled down the wall and fried an extension cord.  FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I decided to apply for a credit card to help build up my credit rating. It seemed smart since I'm a 24 year old college graduate. I was rejected for not having a credit history. Being rejected turns out to hurt your credit history. The irony of my predicament is too great for words. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I realised my girlfriend is the perfect woman for most men. She only ever talks to me in the intermissions on Modern Warfare 2; shame it's not me playing. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, my girlfriend of 3 years left me for a guy whose favorite color is camouflage. FML"}

FML"}

{"cont": "Today, while running errands, I put a frozen water bottle on the dash to thaw out. But when I tried to hurry and turn into busy traffic, the water bottle flew off the dashboard, hit the gear shift and stalled the car out in the middle of the road. I think I was flipped off 12 times. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, my 2 year old had a large booger blocking his nose so I pulled it out. I was on the phone and absentmindedly rolling it around between my thumb and pointer finger. I put it in my mouth and crushed it between my teeth for a solid minute before I remembered what it was. FML"}

{"cont": "Today, my husband actually was cleaning our bathrooms. I had to pee and the floor was wet in my upstairs bathroom. My wonderful husband told me to go downstairs. I did and sat on the toilet seat which felt wet. He forgot he had sprayed it with Tilex. Chemical burns on your butt are great. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I was feeling really stressed so I bought some nice stress relieving lotion. When I got home, I took it out of the bag and accidentally dropped it (not realizing it was made of glass). The bottle shattered into pieces and I even cut my finger on one piece.

{"cont": "Today, I went over to my girlfriend's parents house for dinner. This was the first time I was meeting them, so I bought a $70 bottle of red wine to try and impress them.

{"cont": "Today, my boss made me some tortellini for lunch. As I was happily eating it, he started to give me a massage, while talking to his friends in Greek. He told me that he said \"She's my #1 cashier.\" Turns out, what he really said was \"See, if you feed them well, they let you touch them.\" FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I went to Uni. I woke up at six and got to the station as the train was leaving. I was congratulating myself on my brilliant skill when, as we passed the carpark, I saw I had left my headlights on. It later cost more for the lead to jump start my car than it would have to drive to Uni myself. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, someone gave me a note to pass along to a girl in class. The note had the girl's name surrounded by hearts. When I gave it to her, she assumed it was a love note from me, and said \"Not in a million years, fat ass\" before I could say it was from someone else. FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I was working at Publix ringing up some 70 year old woman. She says \"Man, you're a fast cashier, I like my men fast!\" and then gives me a wink. I got really nervous and didn't know how to respond, so not thinking, I quickly said, \"Yeah, me too.\" FML"}
{"cont": "Today, a guy I'd been seeing off and on for the past three years broke things off over a Facebook message.  I replied, and told him that I was at least worth a phone call.  He replied \"Well, I'm sorry, I disagree.\"  FML"}

FML"}
{"cont": "Today, I was woken by my alarm. I got really tangled up in my blankets, and struggled frantically to untangle myself so I could turn off the alarm. I not only kneed myself in the face, but I accidentally punched myself in the nuts too. Hard. FML"}
